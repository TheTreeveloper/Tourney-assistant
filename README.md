 I belong to an eSports community that I participate in for leisure, we recently have
had difficulty with collecting and calculating results in a timely manner, so I decided 
to take it upon myself to create an app that could make things as automated as possible
to ensure rapid delivery of results for the community. I opted to use React as it's what 
I'm in the process of learning now.
